<h1 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Arabica beans</h1>


<img style="border: #bb9725;border-radius: 10px;margin:auto; display: block; " src="arabica.jpg">



  <P class="pra">Arabica coffee beans are the most popular beans in the world, and there is evidence of Arabica plant growth over 3,000 years ago.
    Arabica beans are larger, sweeter, and more expensive than their prime competition, the Robusta. The added expense is because Arabica beans are harder to grow, needing more water, shade, and higher altitudes than the Robusta.
    Brazil is the leading producer of Arabica beans which typically grow at elevations between 500 and 2500 meters. They are not, however native to Brazil. Arabica beans are thought to have originated in Ethiopia. Their name comes from their use on the Arabian Peninsula, present day Saudi Arabia and Yemen, in the 7th Century.
    Today Arabica plants are grown in over 50 equatorial nations (nations between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn), and the taste and aroma of the beans varies substantially between nations and regions.</P>

  <h1 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Liberica beans</h1>

  <img style="border: #bb9725;border-radius: 10px;margin:auto; display: block; " src="librica.jpg">
  
  
  
    <P class="pra"> Liberica is another species of coffee plant. Unlike Arabica or Robusta, Liberica coffee beans don’t enjoy the same worldwide popularity and make up just 1.5% of global coffee production. Essentially all Liberica production comes from Southeast Asia, specifically the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
        Liberica first originated in Liberia—hence the name—and found its way to Southeast Asia by way of European colonists in the late 19th century. At the time, the coffee world was experiencing one of the worst pandemics of coffee leaf rust, affecting nearly 90% of all Arabica as well as a significant portion of Robusta. Coffee leaf rust is a devastating blight with the potential to wipe out an entire farms worth of coffee plants.
        Liberica, however, demonstrated remarkably resistant properties. Farmers all throughout the Philippines, Malaysia and parts of Indonesia quickly switched over. Although Liberica would also eventually succumb to rust—though not quite to the same extent—the practice of cultivating Liberica survived. Today, Liberica is the most common type of coffee grown in the Philippines and Malaysia, making up over 70% and 90% of all coffee produced there respectively.

    <h1 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Costa Rican beans</h1>

    <img style="border: #bb9725;border-radius: 10px;margin:auto; display: block; " src="costa rica.jpg">
    
    
    
      <P class="pra"> Costa Rican coffees are generally believe to have some of the best coffee flavor profiles in south/central America, with high grown altitudes and a pleasant acidity, leading to great coffee reviews
        The reputation has also resulted it being introduced to Starbucks under their "reserve" program. Its defining tasting notes include a brown-sugary sweetness, citrusy notes and apricot-like fruity flavors.
        When buying Costa Rican coffees for home use, we recommend getting whole bean, fresh roasted coffees direct from coffee roasters. Buying a branded product that sat on a shelf for weeks or months at a grocery store or in Amazon's warehouses will be relatively bland and stale, not allowing you to experience the full flavors of these premium coffees.

      <h1 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Colombia beans</h1>

      <img style="border: #bb9725;border-radius: 10px;margin:auto; display: block; " src="colombia.jpg">
      
      
      
        <P class="pra">Colombia is actually a near-perfect coffee growing climate, and Colombian coffee produces a specific type of bean that results from the environment. Colombia gets heavy rainfall and the landscape never gets close to falling below freezing temperatures at any time of the year. The tropical location is perfect for growing coffee, and grow it does! There are about 600,000 coffee growers in Colombia, and most of them pick the beans by hand.</P>

        <h1 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Ethiopiain beans</h1>

    <img style="border: #bb9725;border-radius: 10px;margin:auto; display: block; " src="ethiubia.jpg">
    
    
    
      <P class="pra"> Coffee plants have grown in the wild in Ethiopia for centuries. Its growing conditions are perfect. The coffee beans from the south have a balanced, light, acidic, and fruity taste. This is because of the tall mountains, good soil, and lush vegetation in the region.

        Because many of the coffee cherries grow on the mountains, they are classified as strictly high grown (SHG). Chemicals are often not required for growth aids, resulting in highest quality specialty coffee.</P>
